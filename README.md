# Welcome to sainapsis mobile test ðŸ‘‹

Take ina ccount this is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project.

this repository has a chat app with a embebed test graphql server to serve the data (which is served from mocks in the server).

This folloing tasks are designed to evaluate:
1. your decicion making skills regarding code architecture improvements
2. React Native / Expo + Typescript skills
3. Native modules (Android + IOs) creation  skills

being that said, we expect you to:

1. improve code quality where you see fit
2. add comments to explain your decicions and if possible make a summary describing them in the readme
3. clone this repository and create a private one that you will share to the given emails as your delirebable.
4. have fun with the test!

## Tasks 

Note: you do not necesarely need to finish them all, make the ones you see fit depending also on the seniority you are aplyiyng too. focus on showing us your skills efficiently and submit the test.

1. Decide if a useCurrentUser hook is needed or use the store directly is better, document why and make the change if needed.
2. Improve the structure of the hooks (grouping them better in folders or somehow make changes that will allow the project to scale in the lng term), document them
3. Create native handle of push notifications that uses best practices in chat push notifications handling (for example in android: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/conversations?hl=es-419)
4. Create the posibility to attach images from the chat by seecting them from the galery of the device with a native module that handles image compresionfor a previsualization before sending and storyng both original and preview in the app local storage for offline optimistic aprroach (if you feel like it, add the server side code to store the images and check that other users get notified)
